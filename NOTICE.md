__To avoid "git bloat", these repositories are reset periodically!__  This is also one of the reasons why this project is distributed in these repositories.  If you get a `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` message while working with your current clone, save the important work from your current clone and reclone.

To understand more about "git bloat", run `du -hs .git` on older more mature projects.  Some might have a very large .git directory.  A very large .git directory can impede working with a git repository, especially when utilizing a slow Internet connection. This is why this repository is periodically reset.
